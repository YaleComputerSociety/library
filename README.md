# y/cs Library

NPM component library for y/cs apps. Built with react, typescript, and tailwind.

## Development

- `npm run build` to build the library

Testing the components is done in the `playground` directory, which is a dummy React app.

- `npm run watch` to set up live loading for style changes (tailwind)
- `npm run dev` to run the playground in dev mode
- `npm run build && npm run preview` from within the playground, after having built the library, to test in production
